# Webtrends Test

As was described in the brief, all of these code snippets are designed for use as added scripts at the bottom of the WT Bank website.

one.css is the CSS code for challenge 1.

two.js and twojquery.js are the JS codes for the JavaScript styling in challenge 2, both vanilla JS and jQuery.

three.js and threejquery.js are the JS codes for the DOM manipulation and event handling in challenge 3, both vanilla JS and jQuery.

four.js is the JS code for the first-party and third-party cookie events, written in vanilla JS.

five.js is the code for the multiple events handling, written in jQuery. The title showing "The Bank That Cares" will show an alert on click and double click, as well as alerts on page load, key press and window resize.

six.js is the regex match expression for the two URLs of mobile and student banking. I'm unsure as to the application, so have written in a small test script on document being ready.
